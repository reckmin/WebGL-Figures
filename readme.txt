Lab 1a
☑ T1
☑ T2
☑ T3
T4 haven't finish, so did not include

Remark to the T3 a) it works, but I don't know why it does not see the array "cameraPosition" from file globals.js(where it should be), 
it worked the day before, but now it isn't, so I just put it together with function in one file "events.js"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested environments:

OS of dev-computer: Windows 11 
Browser: Opera One(version: 103.0.4928.47)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Remarks:

1. For running the project open in the folder command line and input: py -m http.server. 
Open your browser and go to "localhost:8000".

I did not leave much comments, because variable and function's names are clear. 
I used code from the tutorium for class Shape and Cube creation.
